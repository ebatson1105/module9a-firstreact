Assignment 9a: Build your first React Component



Description: This assignment was intended to create a React app using Vite, that will render a created UserProfile component, which includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS

==========================

What I learned: Hard as I tried, I was unable to allow my Powershell (even as administrator) to allow the execution policy to stop scripts from running. Checking into online resources and attempting the commands provided by the instructor did not seem to work. I could not determine how to allow the scripts to complete the assignment. 

That being said, I completed the assigned reading regarding the assignment, and found the comparisons to Legos as building blocks to be a great way to visualize react components. 

I learned that the commands : npm create vite@latest user-profile-lite -- --template react  can be used to set up the user profile, using scripts, and, when working properly on my machine, would allow me to run the created browser and Userprofile at the local host URL provided by the instructor: http://localhost:5173

I also thought the Step 2 section was interesting, as this is where the javascript comes into play, and allows you to set the visual style associated with the project, with commands like <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px', margin: '20px auto', "   etc. This is exciting, because it feels very hands-on, and seems to be a huge step forward towards web design, the way it would be utilized in the real world!

================

Challenges: The biggest challenge I ran into during this assignment was allowing my machine to change its execution policy. I've tried many times, ensured I was running Powershell as admin, and entered the prompts exactly as provided by the instructor, though my machine will not allow the changes to take place, and when attempting to re-enter the initializing code back in Terminal, still receive the error advising that "running scripts is disabled on this system."
